          <h2>Jake Ellis</h2>
          <p>He was drafted at the age of 18 from his home in rural Virginia to serve in the Great War.  He set foot on the great metal ship with a steadfast resolution to do his duty.  To make everyone at home proud.  All of this sentiment evaporated in the face of that great mechanized killing.  Whether it was the purest nobility that the human race had to offer or the basest stupidity made no difference to the machine guns, the diseases, the mustard gas – all of them sank into the mud of France.</p>
          <p>He lost count of the men who he killed, and the letters he sent home to girlfriends and parents for friends he had known.  He lost his faith in the trenches one day of no particular import.  A splash of of red on barbed wire glinting in the sun told him that this butchery had damned them all.  He found he didn’t care overly much.  Any divine being who could sanction something like this was mad anyway.</p>
          <p>When Armistice Day came just after his 20th birthday he was already an old man, the one who stared blankly into the distance as the newly arrived youngsters talked earnestly and shot furtive glances his way.  They couldn’t know the quality of the men they were replacing, how they could never replace them.  And he couldn’t tell them.</p>
          <p>Briefly, after it was all over and he was waiting for demobilization, he fell in love.  There was a French girl, and the stale, dead air was charged once again with some of the magic he knew when he was younger.  He started to dare to believe in new life, and purpose.  And then the Spanish Flu came.  He lost her, and nearly died himself, but the same imbecile providence that had carried him through the war brought him through that as well.</p>
          <p>The Jake Ellis everyone had known never really came home to Virginia, only something else that wore his shape.  His hometown was too small, the people hopelessly provincial, materialistic, and emotionally barren.  He left for the city.  But even all its many vices could never really bite hard enough to let him forget, to make the world new again.  When Prohibition came, it brought a wave of gang violence, and he answered the call and became a cop.  Maybe this was his place to make some sort of mark.</p>

          <p>But he soon found that the force was hopelessly corrupted.  When he found that he couldn’t quite make himself take a bribe or look the other way, he turned on his fellows, gathered evidence, testified in court.</p>
          <p>It didn’t even make a dent, and it ended his career.</p>
          <p>He’s found a peace, of sorts, in the years since, falling into work with the Continental Detective Agency.  He’s become adept at prying up the secrets buried beneath the skin, and even found some satisfaction.  Divorces, murders, extortion, kidnapping – he’s done it all.  And here and there, he’s even managed to make a difference.  And that, along with a string of women, has been enough for him.</p>
          <p class="italic">"The world’s going to push you, and if you don’t let it bend you, you’ll break soon enough.  Nobody can stand forever.  But sometimes, in small ways, you can find a way to make a stand.  And maybe have a few laughs along the way.</p>
