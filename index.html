      <p>I am documenting here my progress in the course.  I've built this web site myself using the knowledge I've gained and deployed it using GitHub.</p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>The sites below I created as I progressed in the course.  You'll see those in the beginning units are very basic, but they become progressively more complex and modern as the course advances.  Throughout the course, I have regularly been guided in how to create sites, step by step, but the projects below mostly represent instances where I was given a site and asked to recreate it from scratch.</p>

          <p>In this unit, I continued to advance in HTML and CSS, and I learned how to use the command line to deploy my sites to the internet.</p>

          <p>Here I was taught how to position items on the page in a modern way. Blocks of text, images, etc. can all be placed with precision.</p>

        <p>In this section, I learned how to make the layout of the page respond to the size of the screen, allowing the site to change displays to better serve mobile and tablet users. Resize the width of the projects below to see this in action.</p>

        <p>For the final project, I used transitions to create more engaging buttons, Bootstrap to make a clean layout, and jQuery to animate the navigation bar and provide a moving carousel of images for the main banner. This project represents the sum total of everything I learned during the course.</p>

      <h2>Review of Codecademy</h2>
      <p>The price of <a href="http://pro.codecademy.com/intensive/build-websites-from-scratch/?utm_campaign=pro_intensive_bws&utm_source=codecademy_platform&utm_medium=course_page&utm_content=learn-html-css&utm_term">Build Web Sites from Scratch</a> was very reasonable ($200), and overall, Codecademy did a stellar job. They provided a series of guided missions designed to lead me step by step through everything I would need to know. Each successful completion of a step was rewarded with a new change on the site I was building, and most steps were accompanied by hints I could open if I got stuck. The course also came with access to a Slack group of other students, where I could go if I needed to ask for help. In general, this format was ideal for learning because I could go at my own pace, and I was taking continual actions rather than trying to passively absorb.</p>
      <p>However, the course was not perfect, and there are several areas I hope that Codecademy improves in future versions. For example, most projects suffered from unclear instructions in multiple places, due to the design spec disagreeing with examples provided. Sometimes hints were missing or unclear, and sometimes turning to the Slack group still yielded no help. As the course advanced, particularly in the final unit, tasks became far more increasingly complex and the steps less well explained, and I often resorted to looking at shared code in order to take these last leaps. And finally, Codecademy provided no indicator of time to the deadline, except for a brief paragraph at the start of the course, so at the end I found myself wondering if I would complete it in time to receive a certificate.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, I would highly recommend this course to anyone with an interest in creating web pages. It was as close to a clean download of a new skill into my brain as I have ever gotten. However, I would seriously consider moving quickly through the first, easier weeks, to build up extra time for the much more complex work at the end. Also, don't be afraid to talk to others and share Github repositories, as seeing others' code in action can be a huge help.</p>
