      <p>I am documenting here my progress in the course.  I've built this web site myself using the knowledge I've gained of HTML and CSS, and deployed it myself using GitHub.</p>
      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>The sites below I created as I progressed in the course.  Throughout the course, I have regularly been guided in how to create sites, step by step, but the projects below mostly represent instances where I was given a site and asked to recreate it from scratch.</p>

        <h3>Unit 3: Command Line and Git</h3>

        <h3>Unit 4: Display and Positioning</h3>
