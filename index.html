      <p><a href="https://ready.codecademy.com/">Codecademy Ready: Build Web Sites from Scratch</a> is an online, 10-week course that teaches the design and deployment of professional web sites using HTML, CSS, GitHub, and JavaScript.</p>
      <p>I am documenting here my progress in the course.  I've built this web site myself using the knowledge I've gained of HTML and CSS, and deployed it myself using GitHub.</p>
      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>The sites below I created as I progressed in the course.  Early in the course, I was guided step by step in creating the site, and later I was given a site and asked to recreate it from scratch.</p>

        <h3>Unit 3: Command Line and Git</h3>
        <p>In this unit, I continued to advance in HTML and CSS, and learned how to use the command line to deploy my sites to the internet, keeping track of versions so that changes could be rolled back.</p>

        <h3>Unit 4: Display and Positioning</h3>
        <p>Here I was taught how to position items on the page in a modern way. Blocks of text, images, etc. can all be placed with precision and flexibly match the sizing of the browser.</p>
